Problem Statement:
In this project, we're tackling the challenge of predicting tsunamis, which is a task crucial for disaster management. Tsunamis can cause massive destruction, so being able to accurately predict them is essential for saving lives and reducing damage. The goal here is to develop a reliable model that can anticipate wheather a tsunami will occur based on geological and temporal data.

Project Solution:
To address this problem, we took several steps. Firstly, we focused on selecting and creating features that could be strong indicators of tsunamis, like earthquake magnitude, location data, and the timing of events. Then, we experimented with different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM and After comparing their performance, we have decided to go with an ensemble model, which combines the strengths of these different approaches. This ensemble model was also fine-tuned by us to get the best balance between catching potential tsunamis (recall) and avoiding false alarms (precision).

Success:
The project was quite successful as we was able to achieve an accuracy of around 78.89% with the ensemble model. Also, the precision for predicting tsunamis was about 83%, meaning the model is pretty reliable for early warnings. This level of accuracy and reliability could be helpful in make a difference in how we approach towards predicting tsunami and response, contributing valuable insights to this field.

Future Scope:
Looking ahead, there are several directions this work could take. One exciting area is integrating the model with real-time data, which could make the predictions even more timely and accurate. There’s also potential to explore quantum computing, which could offer new ways to optimize the model and handle more complex data patterns. On a more basic level, expanding the dataset with more diverse and detailed records would be in help the model generalize better across different regions. Collaborating with experts in geology and oceanography could also provide deeper insights and refine the model further. The main challenges right now are accessing high-quality, real-time data and the computational demands of exploring quantum algorithms, but these are areas we’re are hopeful that in future there will be a lot of work
